# Flappy-bird-game-project-4

This game is a clone to the flappy brid game. All you do is click to make the bird jump and pass through the tubes.

The game uses CSS animation features to create the moving tubes which are placed using HTML5 
and java script to register the key strokes for jumps for the bird, to randomly generate holes in the tubes and to counter
the touch with the tubes and the edge and also to generate scores depending on the distance covered.
